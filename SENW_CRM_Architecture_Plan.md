**Custom CRM Architecture Plan for Real Estate Brokerage**

---

### **1. Objective**
To design a scalable and robust architecture for a custom CRM system tailored to the needs of a real estate brokerage, built using Node.js.

---

### **2. High-Level Architecture Overview**
The CRM system will consist of the following major components:

1. **Frontend**
   - A responsive user interface for agents, admins, and clients.
   - Built with React.js or Angular for dynamic and interactive user experiences.

2. **Backend**
   - Node.js with Express.js for API development.
   - Business logic layer for managing leads, properties, and client data.

3. **Database**
   - PostgreSQL: For structured relational data like user profiles, leads, and properties.
   - MongoDB (optional): For unstructured or semi-structured data like logs or temporary datasets.

4. **Third-Party Integrations**
   - MLS: Data synchronization through RESO Web API or RETS.
   - Email/SMS: Twilio, SendGrid for notifications.
   - Cloud Storage: AWS S3 for storing property images and documents.

5. **Authentication and Security**
   - JWT-based authentication.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC).

6. **DevOps and Deployment**
   - Hosted on AWS, Azure, or GCP.
   - CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
   - Monitoring and logging with tools like Grafana and ELK stack.

### **3. Detailed Architecture Components**

#### **3.1 Backend Components**

**a. API Gateway**
- Centralized routing for all API calls.
- Implements rate limiting and API versioning.

**b. Business Logic Layer**
- Manages workflows for lead assignment, client communication, and property updates.
- Includes validation and data transformation logic.

**c. Task Queue**
- Handles asynchronous operations such as syncing MLS data or sending email notifications.
- Powered by libraries like Bull or Agenda.js.

**d. Real-Time Communication**
- WebSocket (Socket.IO) for live notifications and updates.

**e. MLS Integration**
- Fetch and update property listings from MLS.
- Schedule periodic sync jobs with Node-cron.

#### **3.2 Database Design**

| Table Name       | Key Columns                                          | Purpose                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Users            | id, name, email, role, password_hash                | Stores user details and roles.       |
| Leads            | id, name, contact_info, assigned_to, status         | Tracks lead information.             |
| Properties       | id, mls_id, address, price, status, agent_id        | Stores property listings.            |
| Activities       | id, user_id, action, timestamp                      | Logs user actions for auditing.      |
| Notifications    | id, recipient_id, message, status, created_at       | Tracks notifications sent to users.  |

#### **3.3 Frontend Features**
- **Dashboard**: Display metrics for agents and admins.
- **Lead Management**: Interface to add, update, and assign leads.
- **Property Listings**: Search and manage property data.
- **Notifications**: Real-time alerts for new leads and tasks.

---

#### **3.4 Security Measures**
- **Encryption**: Use TLS for data in transit and AES for sensitive data at rest.
- **Access Control**: Define granular permissions for agents, admins, and clients.
- **Regular Backups**: Automated daily backups of critical data.

### **5. Data Flow**

The following flowchart represents the end-to-end process integrated into the CRM system:

1. **Develop Search Criteria** → Define criteria for identifying potential leads.
2. **Pull List from Data Aggregators** → Fetch data from external sources.
3. **Skip Trace List** → Enrich data with missing contact details.
4. **Scrub List Against DNC** → Ensure compliance with "Do Not Call" regulations.
5. **Format List to Function on Each Platform** → Adapt the list to meet platform requirements.
6. **Automated Targeted Marketing** → Execute campaigns via email, text, social media, and mail.
7. **Gather Data from Campaigns** → Track responses and interactions.
8. **Import Lead Data to CRM** → Consolidate collected data in the CRM system.
9. **Disposition Leads** → Categorize leads based on their status (e.g., hot, cold).
10. **Analyze Properties** → Assess properties for investment potential.
11. **Disposition Deals** → Make decisions on deals (e.g., acquisition, rejection).
12. **Coordinate Transaction** → Manage transactions for successful closure.
