# Custom CRM Architecture Plan for Real Estate Brokerage

## Overview

This repository outlines the architecture plan for developing a **Custom CRM for Real Estate Brokerage**. The CRM will be built using Node.js and designed to be scalable, robust, and tailored for the specific needs of a real estate brokerage, providing tools for managing property listings, leads, client interactions, and transactions.

## Architecture Components

### 1. **Objective**
The objective is to create a CRM system to streamline and manage leads, properties, and client data efficiently. The system will be scalable, flexible, and secure to meet the evolving needs of the brokerage.

### 2. **High-Level Architecture Overview**
The CRM will consist of the following major components:

- **Frontend**: A responsive UI built with React.js or Angular for agent, admin, and client interfaces.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for API development, focusing on managing leads, properties, and client data.
- **Database**:
  - **PostgreSQL** for structured data such as leads, properties, and user profiles.
  - **MongoDB** (optional) for unstructured data like logs.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: MLS, Email/SMS services (Twilio, SendGrid), and Cloud Storage (AWS S3).
- **Authentication & Security**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC).
- **DevOps & Deployment**: Hosted on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, or GCP) with automated CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and logging.

### 3. **Detailed Architecture Components**

#### 3.1 Backend Components

- **API Gateway**: Centralized API routing with rate limiting and versioning.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Manages workflows for lead assignment, client communication, and property updates.
- **Task Queue**: Handles asynchronous operations, powered by Bull or Agenda.js.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Implemented with WebSocket (Socket.IO) for live updates and notifications.
- **MLS Integration**: Integration for syncing property data using RESO Web API or RETS.

#### 3.2 Database Design

| Table Name       | Key Columns                                          | Purpose                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Users            | id, name, email, role, password_hash                | Stores user details and roles.       |
| Leads            | id, name, contact_info, assigned_to, status         | Tracks lead information.             |
| Properties       | id, mls_id, address, price, status, agent_id        | Stores property listings.            |
| Activities       | id, user_id, action, timestamp                      | Logs user actions for auditing.      |
| Notifications    | id, recipient_id, message, status, created_at       | Tracks notifications sent to users.  |

#### 3.3 Frontend Features
- **Dashboard**: Metrics for agents and admins.
- **Lead Management**: Interface to add, update, and assign leads.
- **Property Listings**: Interface to search, view, and manage property data.
- **Notifications**: Real-time alerts for new leads and updates.

#### 3.4 Security Measures
- **Encryption**: Use TLS for data in transit and AES for sensitive data at rest.
- **Access Control**: Granular permissions for agents, admins, and clients.
- **Regular Backups**: Automated daily backups of critical data.

### 4. **Responsibilities and Workflow**
